# Analysis of Cryptocurrency Clusters

This analysis uses a cryptocurrency dataset in order to conduct PCA (principal component analysis) and data clustering. The goal is to detect and use an optimal KMeans value in order to identify patterns in the data.

## Technologies

This project utilizes python 3.7 and the following packages:

[jupyterlab](https://jupyter.org/)

[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

[pyviz](https://pyviz.org/)

[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)

[holoviews](http://holoviews.org/)

The project has been constructed in a [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyter.org/) notebook entitled `crypto_investments.ipynb`.

## Installation Guide

To clone the repository to your computer, first make sure you are using python version 3.7 or greater by typing the following:

`python -V`

Next, confirm that the packages are installed by using the following code lines:

`pip install pandas`

`pip install pyviz`

`pip install hvplot`

`pip install scikit-learn`

`pip install jupyterlab`

## Usage

In order to view the project, navigate to the `san_francisco_housing.ipynb` notebook in the repository directory. If you cannot find the file, simply click [here](https://github.com/MaxAcheson/module_10_challenge/blob/main/Starter_Code/crypto_investments.ipynb) instead. If you would like to interact with the live version of the analysis, you may navigate to your cloned version of the repository in your terminal and run `jupyter lab`.

Since the analysis figures do not render live on GitHub, the figures from the analysis have been provided below, along with their corresponding notebook cell.
